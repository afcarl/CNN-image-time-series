Reference Research Papers

[0]He Kaiming et at.
- Used parametric rectified activation units in neural net + robust initialization method
26% improvement over 2014 winner (4.94 versus 6.66%) Supassed human-level performance (5.1%)!!!


[13] A. G. Howard. Some improvements on deep convolutional neural network based image classification. arXiv:1312.5402, 2013.
- This paper addes image transformation to training data (scale, view, color, crop) - 20% better than previous year winner



[12] G. E. Hinton, N. Srivastava, A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and R. R. Salakhutdinov. Improving neural networks by pre- venting co-adaptation of feature detectors. arXiv:1207.0580, 2012.
- Used 'dropout' to prevent complex co-adaptation (meaning ?). Set new records on speech and object recognition.
- Dataset - TIMIT: acoustic phonetic continuous speech corpus
- Reuters corpus volume
- CIFAR-10 : CNN
- ImageNet : CNN
- This paper has great summary of CNNs



[20] A. L. Maas, A. Y. Hannun, and A. Y. Ng. Rectifier nonlinearities improve neural network acoustic models. In ICML, 2013.
- mentioned that Gloret et al. 2011 found that DNNs with rectifier nonlinearities perform better than sigmoidal model for image recognition and classification task
- compared the hidden representations of rectifier and sigmoidal networks : offers insight as to why rectifier nonlinearities perform well.
