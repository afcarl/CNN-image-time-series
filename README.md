- Used 'dropout' to prevent complex co-adaptation (meaning ?). Set new records on speech and object recognition.
- Dataset - TIMIT: acoustic phonetic continuous speech corpus
- Reuters corpus volume
- CIFAR-10 : CNN
- ImageNet : CNN
- This paper has great summary of CNNs



[20] A. L. Maas, A. Y. Hannun, and A. Y. Ng. Rectifier nonlinearities improve neural network acoustic models. In ICML, 2013.
- mentioned that Gloret et al. 2011 found that DNNs with rectifier nonlinearities perform better than sigmoidal model for image recognition and classification task
- compared the hidden representations of rectifier and sigmoidal networks : offers insight as to why rectifier nonlinearities perform well.
